		This page is a "View Harness".  It can be used to help an HTML/CSS
		designer build, tune, and maintain visual components.  It applies
		the same document baseline as the app (document type, document mode,
		etc.).  Note: reset stylesheets are loaded dynamically in this
		application so they are loaded the same way in this harness.  If
		your app loads stylesheets statically (eww), then you'd load then
		statically here.

		Take a peek at the test/ui/launch.html file to see one way to
		load this harness.
